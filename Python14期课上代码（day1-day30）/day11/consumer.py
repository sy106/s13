# You may ask why we declare the queue again ‒ we have already declared it in our previous code.
# We could avoid that if we were sure that the queue already exists. For example if send.py program
# was run before. But we're not yet sure which program to run first. In such cases it's a good
# practice to repeat declaring the queue in both programs.
